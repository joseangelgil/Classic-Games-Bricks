# Bricks
A classic game where the player has to break all the bricks to win.

This project was made from scratch based on the classic game "Brick Breaker" for learning purposes only, as part of my own programming learning path. 

It helped me to keep practicing and strengthen my knwoledge with frontend technologies and concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Canvas and Object Oriented Programming.
